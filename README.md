Python homework for EMER-VIRT-DATA-PT-03-2021-U-C to summarize two data sets and export summaries as .txt.
Two files were to be analyzed, "PyBank_Resources_budget_data.csv" and "PyPoll_Resources_election_data.csv" using Python Coding.
The analysis of these files have the specific requirements for output. The two analysis are codenamed PyBank and PyPoll.

For PyBank Output Requiremnts: 
The total number of months included in the dataset,
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,
Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes,
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period,
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

For PyPoll Output Requirements:
The total number of votes cast,
A complete list of candidates who received votes,
The percentage of votes each candidate won,
The total number of votes each candidate won,
The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Both outputs needed to display the summary onto the Python Terminal and also export the results as a .txt file.
The Python coding for the analysis of both files are posted here in this repository. The code has an absolute location and need to be changed according the system.

The data for PyBank is arranged in columns, "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
The script for the analysis of PyBank has to be used in the current order of the data, if the data needs to be sorted, it has to be sorted by date since the coding analyzes the data sequentially by rows.

The data for PyPoll is arranged in columns, "VoterID", "County", and "Candidate"
The script for the analysis of PyPoll can be used sorted in any order.
